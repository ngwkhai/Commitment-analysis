Currently, [the SvelteKit (v1)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?b=main&s=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fvercel%2Fvercel%2Ftree%2Fmain%2Fexamples%2Fsveltekit-1&showOptionalTeamCreation=false&template=sveltekit-1&teamCreateStatus=hidden) example fails with:
```
ERR_PNPM_OUTDATED_LOCKFILE  Cannot install with ""frozen-lockfile"" because pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date with package.json
```

This fixes the lockfile, and therefore fixes the example.

Say you have a middleware (`middleware.js`) that looks like this:

```js
export async default function middleware(req, ctx) {

}

async function tooLongFunction() {
  console.log('tooLongFunction started')
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 10000))
  console.log('tooLongFunction finished')
}
```

When you run this middleware locally with `vercel dev`, you won't see the `tooLongFunction finished` message because the server process is killed right after finishing the response. While Edge Runtime's `server.close()`, which awaits all `waitUntil` promises, is called, but `exit-hook`'s callback in CLI doesn't wait for the `close` promise to resolve.

As titled. Increases api page size for `vc project ls` when
`--deprecated` is used.

This is a temporary workaround since we do the filtering ""client-side"".
We will eventually update the API itself to support this and then we can
remove the client-based filter and reduce the page limit back to the
ideal `20`.

https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/10819 introduced a bug causing the `prepareCache()` function to fail (due to `@remix-run/dev` no longer being require-able).

It seems the intention of this test was to verify that the rewritten

compare the contents with the rewritten script, but this relies on

this just asserts on a valid status code, as a chunk that isn't properly

Fixes a neat little bug with the intersection of northstar users, teams, and the behavior of `Array#find_index`:

When selecting an org for various cli actions _non_ northstar users will see a select list with their user in the 0th position, and their teams in the 1..nth positions, like so:

```
// user: Logan
// teams: [Avengers, X-Men]
○ Logan
○ Avengers
○ X-Men
``` 

We'd like to preselect either a team referenced in `client.config.currentTeam` or if said team cannot be found in the collection of a user's teams, preselect the user. So if `X-Men` is `currentTeam`, we find that item (element `1` in the teams array) and increment that value by `1` to account for the user being element `0` in the list of choices:

```
// currentTeam: X-Men
// user: Logan
// teams: [Avengers, X-Men]
○ Logan
○ Avengers
● X-Men
``` 

If we _can't_ find the `currentTeam` in the list of teams (or one isn't provided), `Array#find_index` returns `-1`, which we increment to by `1` to get the 0th element in the list of choices:

```
// currentTeam: undefined
// user: Logan
// teams: [Avengers, X-Men]
● Logan
○ Avengers
○ X-Men
``` 

Neat trick!

However, Northstar users _don't_ use the user account as the 0th element in the list of choices. Northstar users will in fact have a team that represents a hidden default team with the same name as their `user.name` and this will be the 0th element in their teams:

```
// user: Logan
// teams: [Logan, Avengers, X-Men]
○ Logan
○ Avengers
○ X-Men
``` 

This of course means the trick of `+1` to index of the team selects the wrong item _and_ can result in `undefined` in cases where the `currentTeam` references the last team.

```
// currentTeam: X-Men
// user: Logan
// teams: [Logan, Avengers, X-Men]
○ Logan
○ Avengers
○ X-Men
``` 

● how'd we get out here?!?! 👀 

To address the issue this PR:
1. calls `findIndex` on the array of _choices_ checking for matches to `currentTeam`
2. wraps that in `Math.max` to set to `0` if `find_index` returns `-1` when a `currentTeam` can't be found.",2023,11

Makes `getLatestNodeVersion()` and `getSupportedNodeVersion()` (and thus by extension - `getNodeVersion()`) be aware of the available Node.js versions when running inside the build-container. This is to address the situation with the new AL2023 build-container image which has different Node versions installed compared to the existing AL2 build image.

### Project Settings `20.x` with package.json `""engines"": ""18.x""`

If the Project Settings Node Version is set to `20.x`, but the package.json has `""engines"": ""18.x""`, then the build will fail like so, because Node 18 is not present on the AL2023 build image:

This PR adds improved error handling for the 200 project limit error
that will start being returned for free tier teams/accounts. The
following changes have been made:
- improve error message format by using `client.output.prettyError` so
that the docs link
(https://vercel.com/docs/limits/overview#general-limits) returned with
the error response is included with the error message
- add explicit error handling of this error from any places where
`createProject` is called, which includes the following commands:
  - `vc project add`
  - `vc link` (indirectly called via `ensureLink`)
  - `vc list` (indirectly called via `ensureLink`)
  - `vc git connect` (indirectly called via `ensureLink`)

### Testing
- sign in to a vercel account that is associated with your work email
(ends in `@vercel.com`), this is necessary for creating a team with the
proper conditions to artificially trigger the error message
- create a Pro Trial team and make sure to prefix the name with:
`vtest314 too many projects `, for example `vtest314 too many projects
test 1`
- check out this branch and cd to `vercel/vercel/packages/cli`
- run: `pnpm dev add [project-name] --cwd=/path/to/some/project`
- the project should fail to be created and you should see the expected
error message (screenshot below) in the terminal output

When using `basePath` with statically generated routes, the builder
currently generates lambdas for the root route that conflict with the
prerender functions generated.

E.g. if we have `basePath: ""test""` and a root route at: `app/page.js`,
this is currently the output:

```
test
test.rsc
test/index
test/index.rsc
```

The result is that visiting the deployed app at `/test` renders an
incomplete page. On the other hand visiting `/test/index` outputs the
expected markup.

It seems like the intent is that we want to delete the lambdas that
conflict with the prerender functions. I've updated the lambda name
generation logic when doing the deleting to line up with how the lambda
names are generated initially.",2023,11

The `try to purchase a domain` CLI test starting failing on  11 October when the API became slightly slower to respond. This is because `vercel domains buy example.com` displays a prompt asking the user to `y` into agreeing to the purchase. We interacted with this in tests by spamming `y` on STDIN for a few seconds. The timing required is now a bit longer but I think we can skip that pattern entirely by passing the `--yes` option to the subcommand.

I don't _think_ we want this anywhere but in CI and let people unintentionally buy domains , so I've gated the use based on that, but happy to make it available always.

Allows to define a `statusCode` property on `rewrites` in the same way as we already have it for `redirects`.
This is still blocked internally as it requires a feature flag to build with that setting.

So it would allow to set the status in `vercel.json` like this:
```json
{
  ""rewrites"": [
    {
      ""source"": ""/*"",
      ""destination"": ""not-found.html"",
      ""statusCode"": 404
    }
  ]
}

```

Once released, I'll update the documentation on that as well.

> Cause once router sees a status code is set, it stops routing.
> So it wont run the `miss` and `rewrite` sections again once it has a status.
> So just need to make sure wherever status code is set, its at the end of its routing.

This adds a new `pnpm type-check` that leverages `turbo` to validate the TypeScript code. This can be run at the top-level or for an individual package.

The `test-lint` workflow will run it after linting and doing the prettier check.

As apart of this effort, each package's `tsconfig.json` has been simplified. There's a new top-level `tsconfig.base.json` file that extends the Vercel Style Guide for TypeScript. Each package's `tsconfig.json` has been audited and previously suppressed rules that no longer apply have been removed. The result is each package's `tsconfig.json` is greatly simplified and we can control common settings in the base config while keeping the flexibility of package-level overrides.

Lastly, in `package/cli`, `pnpm build` calls `scripts/build.mjs` which calls `scripts/compile-templates.mjs`. The `compile-templates.mjs` file was generating invalid TypeScript code. I've fixed it and now it's happier than ever.

Note: In order to run `pnpm type-check`, you must first `pnpm build` because we need the `.d.ts` definition files.",2023,10

While investigating build times noticed that our lambda creation times were increasing linearly with the number of pages which is unexpected since there are mostly shared dependencies. After further investigation it seems we were falling back to our legacy manual `nodeFileTrace` calls in the builder when we shouldn't have been.

Also noticed we were still doing the un-necessary reading/calculating for uncompressed lambda sizes which is as discussed previously isn't required and the only limit we need to keep enforcing is the uncompressed size which is a lot less expensive to compute. 

As a further optimization this adds proper usage of our lstat cache/sema where it wasn't previously and proper parallelizing where applicable. 

These changes reduce tracing/lambda creation times by 3-5x in larger applications and can fix edge cases where we weren't leveraging our more accurate traces from the build.

As part of a refactor in #10535, we lost the – admittedly untested – behavior of 

1. setting the new `teamId` from a login `result`
2. removing this value if it was `undefined` ensuring we didn't write `""currentTeam"": undefined` to `config.json`.

This resulted in subsequent calls to `vc login` keeping the last known defined `teamId`.

This should restore that behavior but also retain the behavior of calling `updateCurrentTeamAfterLogin` to check if the user has a new `defaultTeamId` to be stored.

Not a fan of just how much mutation exists on `client.config` in this flow, but that predates this change and I wanted to keep this bugfix as small as possible.",2023,9

Fixes a issue when a Next.js app uses app router + edge runtime + instrumentation hook deployed out on Vercel.  The issue is that the code to register the instrumentation hook in Next.js expects `_ENTRIES` to be defined on `globalThis`.

```ts
async function registerInstrumentation() {
  console.log(""'_ENTRIES' in globalThis:"", '_ENTRIES' in globalThis)
  console.log(
    '_ENTRIES.middleware_instrumentation:',

    Boolean(_ENTRIES.middleware_instrumentation.register)
  )

  if (

This was causing a bug because my assumption about turbo cache hit/miss was incorrect. 

I thought `turbo run test-e2e --listTests` would be use the same cache as `turbo run test-e2e` but it does not. So what was happening is that tests were not running on a second push to a PR because turbo already ""cached"" the result of `--listTests` so that `new-only` was saying there are no new tests and nothing to run 🤦",2023,9

Some time along the way this was changed from development only, to always being installed.

However, no longer need this package because we can enable source maps for development by using [`--enable-source-map`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/cli.html#--enable-source-maps) which has been available since Node.js 12",2023,9

This PR effectively reverts the change in https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/9172 since it is safe to skip tests that are not part of the turbo cache miss results. Previously, we were unable to do this because all of those jobs/checks were marked as required on the github repo settings. But now we have a single [""Summary"" job](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/f6e863d4bbdeb755eb89f1c621bf38dddc7399e1/.github/workflows/test.yml#L111-L128) that is marked as required at the repo level so now we don't need to create jobs anymore just to see the turbo cache hit go green.

is being bumped. This would normally happen anyways, but does not happen

# Problem

Framework authors often produce build outputs from platforms like Github
Actions or M1 Macs where the arm64 architecture is being used. They then
deploy these outputs to Vercel using `vercel deploy`, bypassing Vercel's
build system. Today they must cross compile to x86_64 in order to deploy
compatible Serverless functions to Vercel.

# Solution

Allow Framework authors to detect the current architecture and specify
either x86_64 or arm64 when deploying a Serverless function to Vercel.

# Summary

Edge-runtime 2.4.4 has many bug fixes, but most importantly it adds support for stream cancellation to the edge runtime. This is extremely important since a lot of projects are using `streams` related to `ai`. They currently have no way of handling a cancellation coming from the client.

This was introduced to `next` with as described by this comment: https://github.com/vercel-labs/ai/issues/90#issuecomment-1618915409

You can find the PR for that here: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/51727

It also has a good description for what we're trying to do here, but for people not using `next`

# Problem

When a client sends an abort signal, it is currently not being handled by edge functions. This was fixed in edge-runtime@2.4.4

# Solution

Update the package",2023,8

We noticed some edge function builds are failing unexpectedly due to `SyntaxError`. It's triggered by valid code in [Webpack's style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader/blob/16e401b17a39544d5c8ca47c9032f02e2b60d8f5/src/runtime/styleDomAPI.js#L35C1-L40C1):

    css += `\n/*# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,${btoa(
      unescape(encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(sourceMap)))
    )} */`;
  }
```

After minification this script looks like:

```
sourceMap&&typeof btoa!=""undefined""&&(css+=`
/*# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;base64,${btoa(unescape(encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(sourceMap))))} */`);
```

The key point here is `\n` is replaced with newline character (`0x0A`) and the second line starts with `/*# sourceMappingURL=`. This confuses `removeComments` API in [convert-source-map](https://github.com/thlorenz/convert-source-map/tree/master) package and it removes the second line:

```

Instead of including the fork `@remix-run/dev` package as a regular dependency of `@vercel/remix-builder`, install it at build-time by modifying the project's `package.json` file. The reasons for this are:

* Avoids deprecation warnings from a few packages that currently exist on the `@remix-run/dev` package when installing Vercel CLI (those warnings already show up in the build logs anyways, so nothing new there).
* Allows us to install a version as close as possible to the version specified in the user's `package.json` (similar to how we do when auto-injecting the `@vercel/remix` package). This will be especially important once Remix v2 is released, which will have breaking changes compared to v1.

**Note:** `@vercel/remix-run-dev` is still a _dev_ dependency, so that we can use TypeScript types from it, as well as, at runtime, we use the version in the Builder's `package.json` to determine the maximum versions of `@vercel/remix-run-dev` and/or `@vercel/remix` which can safely be installed.

Followup PR to #10090. Some of our commands duplicate global options into their `args` structure e.g. https://github.com/vercel/vercel/blob/2661f56347d5c32de369a6cea74bc9fb46d565a2/packages/cli/src/commands/logs.ts#L25-L26

 Others commands omit it entirely.

This updates the `--help` output for commands migrated to our new structure (so far, only `deploy`) will show a ""Global Options"" section:

```
▲ vercel deploy [project-path] [options]

Deploy your project to Vercel. The `deploy` command is the default command for the Vercel CLI, and can be omitted (`vc deploy my-app` equals `vc my-app`).

Options

  --archive                    Compress the deployment code into a file before uploading it
  -b, --build-env <key=value>  Specify environment variables during build-time (e.g. `-b KEY1=value1 -b KEY2=value2`)
  -e, --env <key=value>        Specify environment variables during run-time (e.g. `-e KEY1=value1 -e KEY2=value2`)
  -f, --force                  Force a new deployment even if nothing has changed
  -m, --meta <key=value>       Specify metadata for the deployment (e.g. `-m KEY1=value1 -m KEY2=value2`)
  --no-wait                    Don't wait for the deployment to finish
  --prebuilt                   Use in combination with `vc build`. Deploy an existing build
  --prod                       Create a production deployment
  -p, --public                 Deployment is public (`/_src`) is exposed)
  --regions                    Set default regions to enable the deployment on
  --with-cache                 Retain build cache when using ""--force""
  -y, --yes                    Use default options to skip all prompts

Global Options

  --cwd <DIR>                Sets the current working directory for a single run of a command
  -d, --debug                Debug mode (default off)
  -Q, --global-config <DIR>  Path to the global ${'`.vercel`'} directory
  -h, --help                 Output usage information
  -A, --local-config <FILE>  Path to the local `vercel.json` file
  --no-color                 No color mode (default off)
  -S, --scope                Set a custom scope
  -t, --token <TOKEN>        Login token
  -v, --version              Output the version number

The discontinue date for `nodejs16.x` needs to be pushed back until we can add support for `nodejs20.x`.

Currently `nodejs18.x` can cause problems with native packages that depend on a specific version of glibc so the only solution for that use case is to stay on `nodejs16.x` at this time.

This PR disabled `node-fetch` default compression handling when the
response is not streamed.

The default behavior in node-fetch is to handle the compression. That's
great if you interact with node-fetch as user, but bad if you use it as
intermediate proxy server, since it's creating a mismatching related
with the body format and length expectations.

Instead, we disable compression, get the buffered response and compress
it again if needed.

As noticed this is copying all fallback files from output even if they are already on the disk in the build container which should be able to be considered a ""pure"" environment. This copying can cause disk space/perf issues when there are massive amounts of fallback files generated e.g. 8000 outputs at 200KB/output is already 1.6GB of copying needing to be done that could just be a move operation.

The `getNodeBinPath()` function is problematic because it assumes that commands are installed in the `node_modules` directory alongside the detected lockfile. This works fine the majority of the time, but ends up not being the case when using a monorepo that uses a package manager in ""linked"" mode (i.e. pnpm by default).

Consider the following:

```
.
├── pnpm-lock.yaml
├── node_modules
├── blog
│   ├── node_modules
│   │   ├── hexo -> .pnpm/hexo@3.9.0/node_modules/hexo
```

In this setup, adding the root-level `node_modules/.bin` would not make the `hexo` command be visible in the `$PATH`.

To solve this issue, the new `getNodeBinPaths()` function returns an array of all directories up to the specified `root`, which can then be placed into the `$PATH`. It's also more efficient (synchronous) since it does not need to scan for a lockfile anymore (the `root` needs to be specified explicitly).

The new function is being used in `@vercel/next` and `@vercel/static-build`.

The `traverseUpDirectories()` function from CLI was moved to `build-utils` to implement this function. Consequently, that makes the implementations of `walkParentDirs()` and `walkParentDirsMulti()` simpler, since it's using this generator now.",2023,6

### Description
This ensures the Summary job always runs to check if any test failed and
cause itself to fail as well.

This allows us to dynamically add as many concurrent jobs as we want but
only have one (Summary) marked as required.

### Testing
I verified this worked by making a change to `@vercel/static-config`
which is not required and the Summary check failed:

https://github.com/vercel/vercel/actions/runs/5136560652/jobs/9243924596

Then I reverted it so that the test was passing and the Summary check
passed:

Hey team,

I had an error this morning when trying to link my repo using the CLI 
![Screenshot 2023-05-17 at 11 38 01](https://github.com/vercel/vercel/assets/1637651/798d6e4f-8c9e-41b7-b712-0322001fca02)


Seems like a combination of `: any` and a recent refacto introduced an issue here.

~- Removed all `any` that were hiding the error~
- Correctly pass the URL already parsed

~- Removed the second useless parsing~
~- Added missing `--help` flag~
  ~I noticed you never specify them and Typescript screams because of that, not sure if on purpose and how you make the compilation pass with this error. Don't hesitate to tell me.~

The fix could be improved by using `arg.Result<THE_ACTUAL_TYPE>` but that would require to store the dictionnary of flags somewhere else and also create an external type. This is already better so...

In a Next.js app, if you have Node.js Functions in both `api` and `pages/api`, you'll get a warning about moving those `api` functions into `pages/api`. This does specify Node.js Functions already, but a user was confused and tried to move their non-Node.js functions into `pages/api` as well.

This PR tries to make it clearer that you can do both. Note that this still requires a non-ideal local dev setup where you:

- update next config to fall back to the `vc dev` port for `api` handlers
- run `next dev` for the Next.js app on one port
- run `vc dev` for the top-level `api` Functions on another port

link to a Git URL rather then directly to a single Vercel Project. This
allows for multiple Projects to be linked simultaneously, which is
useful for monorepo setups.

Follow-up to https://github.com/vercel/vercel/pull/9974 this uses the `lambdaAppPaths` as the source of truth instead of the manifest which is more accurate for separating/detecting. Also adds additional test cases for new root and index app functions.

# Vercel CLI Extensions

Adds a new mechanism to add additional sub-commands to Vercel CLI, inspired by how Git handles sub-commands:

* Extensions are standalone executables that Vercel CLI will spawn as a child process.
* The name of the executable must begin with `vercel-`. For example, to add a sub-command called `vercel example`, there should exist an executable called `vercel-example`.
* The executable can either be a npm package with a `""bin""` entry installed into the local project's workspace, or be globally available in the `$PATH`.
* Extensions can access the [Vercel REST API](https://vercel.com/docs/rest-api), pre-authenticated, by utilizing the `VERCEL_API` env var. Vercel CLI spawns a local HTTP server that adds the `Authorization` header and then proxies to the Vercel REST API.

## Environment Variables

A few environment variables which provide features and context to the extension:

| Name      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| `VERCEL_API`      | HTTP URL to access the pre-authenticated Vercel API.       |
| `VERCEL_TEAM_ID`  | Provided when the currently selected scope is a Team. |
| `VERCEL_DEBUG` | Provided when the `--debug` flag is used. The command _may_ output additional debug logging. |
| `VERCEL_HELP` | Provided when the `--help` flag is used. The command _should_ print the help output and then end with exit code **2**. |

## Example

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo Hi, from a Vercel CLI Extension!
user=""$(curl -s ""$VERCEL_API/v2/user"" | jq -r .user.username)""
echo ""Logged in as: $user""
```

Usage:

```
$ vc example

Hi, from a Vercel CLI Extension!
Logged in as: tootallnate

This PR exposes `WebSocket` to be used for Edge Runtime for `vc dev`.

Ideally, that's a thing we should to handle inside `edge-runtime`

Unfortunately, that is not as easy as it sounds, since Edge Runtime is
doing a heavy use of vm module and `undici` is using some Node.js APIs
that are not available, or they are hard to make them working inside vm.

Related PR: https://github.com/vercel/edge-runtime/pull/309

While we're finishing that work, in order to don't delay users to start
using `WebSocket`, we can simply expose it directly from `undici` as
dependency.

When `@vercel/node` was created 5 or so years ago, Node.js didn't support ESM out of the box. So to create a zero configuration experience, babel was introduce to compile the authored ESM into the runtime CJS.

Today, Node.js supports ESM but you have to opt in using `type: module` in package.json or the `.mjs` file extension.

Indeed `@vercel/node` detects ESM and skips babel compilation. However, there is a case where the source code is ESM and a dependency supports both ESM and CJS via `imports` in package.json. This case will break because `@vercel/nft` traces the source file as ESM and assumes the dependency will be resolved as ESM too. But after `@vercel/nft` traces the source file, `@vercel/node` will compile to CJS and thus the trace will be incorrect and fail at runtime.

So this PR adds a warning when babel compiles ESM to CJS because it is no longer expected in 2023.",2023,4

Normally this deployment takes around 30 seconds, but the `--no-wait` flag causes the command to exit in less than 2 seconds.

The next step is to add the ability for `vc inspect` to wait as well as specify the maximum time to wait (defaults to 3 minutes, same as `vc rollback`).

Welcome to the grand splitting of CLI integration tests:

- replaced `test-cli` test suite with `test-e2e`
- made some small fixes along the way
- split integration tests into 3 files
- moved shared logic to `packages/cli/test/helpers/*`
- simplified `_execa` / `execa` / `execute` usage into `execCli` and `exec`
    - simplified arguments required to make these work
- defaulted `execCLI` to set `NO_COLOR=1` to make assertions simpler in tests that aren't testing color/emoji support
- expanded functionality of `formatOutput` to handle error states
- centralized temp dir handling and cleanup
- enhanced `waitForPrompt` to:
    - more clearly show what it was waiting for
    - support waiting for regex, string, or a function that returns a boolean
    - show what was the most recent thing it saw
    - end early if the process it's monitoring exits
- removed some test pollution where unnecessary, shifted some into `beforeAll`
- renamed unit tests helper from `setupFixture` to `setupUnitFixture` to avoid confusion with the new shared helper `setupE2EFixture`


Some of this could be pulled out into a separate PR, but the feedback cycle is a slog, which this PR is helping to address. I'd be happy to discuss what could be pulled out, but I'd also be happy to get the whole thing through.

- `vc build` builds wrong arch on Apple Silicon/arm64
- `vc build` on Windows doesn't properly resolve ""builds"" in `vercel.json` due to posix separator issue

**Moving the `public` dir** is what currently happens. This causes Gatsby to believe that the build was not complete:

> info We've detected that the Gatsby cache is incomplete (the .cache directory exists but the public directory does not). As a precaution, we're deleting your site's cache to ensure there's no stale data.

**Copying the `public` dir** is not an option because it can cause a build to run out of space.

**Symlinking the `public` dir** would work, but it would require more changes throughout the system to make sure the symlink was followed properly.

**Hard Linking the `public` dir's files** is the best option. This PR links the directories instead of moving them. We did look for a library that already does the `hardlinkFileTree` thing, but couldn't find one.

Remix v1.14.0 added support for having no `app/entry.server.tsx`/`app/entry.client.tsx` files in a project (there are default versions bundled into `@remix-run/dev`). Projects configured like this are currently failing because we symlink our forked version of the `remix` CLI into the project, so it cannot resolve the necessary modules at build time.

To solve this, instead of relying on the default versions of these files in `@remix-run/dev` package, we'll include our own versions in `@vercel/remix`, and physically copy them into the project dir. This way, the modules used will be properly resolved relative to the project's own `node_modules` dir.

Our default version of `app/entry.server.tsx` is also slightly different then upstream one, because it uses `@vercel/remix-entry-server` to enable isomorphic React streaming on both Node + Edge runtimes. Because of this, if that dependency is not present, then we'll automatically install the dependency at build-time.",2023,3

Updates the `responseHeaders` probe checks to properly test for multiple headers with the same name.

Previously the probes were using `headers.get()` which concats multiple headers into a single string, which results in the test not really checking if there are in fact multiple headers with the same name. Using `headers.raw()` allows us to properly test for that.

A couple of Python tests that were already checking for multiple `set-cookie` headers needed to be updated to match the full value, since the check now properly validates the full string match of each header (before it was basically just doing a `string.includes()` check).

where it ""can"" cause it to fail, including with NextJS 13.1.6 and Vercel
CLI 28.16.2, but it is not guaranteed to fail. I have six NextJS
projects. They have identical next.config.js, tsconfig.json,
eslintrc.js, and .gitignore files, and other than a few seemingly
non-critical dependencies they have identical package.json files. Four
of the six consistently built and deployed in the cloud without issue.
Two consistently failed to build in the cloud. All built successfully
locally including using vercel build locally, and all would vercel
deploy --prebuilt successfully. Switching all the vercel cloud project
settings from Node 14.x to Node 18.x enabled all the projects to build
and deploy successfully in the vercel cloud without needing local vercel
build and local vercel deploy --prebuilt steps.

This PR changes the fallback headers that relate to RSC to the defaults that Next.js currently uses. Also, it sets the initial `vary` header to all prerendered routes when RSC is enabled (`routesManifest?.rsc`), even for the pages directory. 

That's because although the pages directory won't return any RSC payload, it can still be used in a project that contains app routes. When the app route requests a page route for RSC data, it's important for the browser to not accidentally cache that result hence we need the `vary` header to set there as well.

This PR changes the way cron jobs are being created in the build output
API. This is my first time contributing here. If you see something
unusual, let me know.

✅ Good for review

Our goal is to:
- Allow creating cron jobs via the `crons` property of `vercel.json` for
end users
- Allow framework authors to create cron jobs on Vercel via the `crons`
property of the Build Output API configuration

---

As you can see, we removed the previous implementation where cron jobs
could be configured at the function code level (export const cron = """"),
on top of vercel.json `functions` property. Here's why:

- All frameworks would have to implement the configure at the function
code level
- Not all frameworks can easily map a path to a specific function
(example: SvelteKit) and would have to bail on bundling functions inside
the same lambda
- Configuring a path + scheduler provides a better mapping of what cron
jobs are as of today: API routes on a schedule and not functions on a
schedule
- Dynamic routes Cron Jobs will be supported:
/api/crons/sync-slack-team/230
- Query parameters will be supported support:
/api/crons/sync-slack-team/230?secret=32k13l2k13lk21 (= securing cron
jobs v0)
- 100% frameworks compatibility from day one

Next.js and other frameworks may choose to implement their own cron jobs
feature that will then need to be configured through the `crons`
property of `config.json` (build output API).

This adds a new package to the monorepo: `@vercel/remix-entry-server`

The purpose of this package is to provide most of the implementation of
the Remix `app/entry.server.tsx` file with proper support for the Vercel
Serverless and Edge runtimes, specifically in regards to React 18
streaming.

The reason that this package is necessary, as opposed to just updating
our Remix template, is due to the fact that Serverless and Edge runtimes
require a different implementation. This is because the
`react-dom/server` package exports different functions for the Node
(`renderToPipeableStream()`) vs. Edge (`renderToReadableStream()`)
bundles, and thus this package also has two different implementations
(by utilizing the `main` and `browser` fields in `package.json`).

Usage of this package in a Remix application's `app/entry.server.tsx`
file looks like:

```tsx
import handleRequest from ""@vercel/remix-entry-server"";
import { RemixServer } from ""@remix-run/react"";
import type { EntryContext } from ""@remix-run/server-runtime"";

export default function (
  request: Request,
  responseStatusCode: number,
  responseHeaders: Headers,
  remixContext: EntryContext
) {
  const remixServer = <RemixServer context={remixContext} url={request.url} />;
  return handleRequest(request, responseStatusCode, responseHeaders, remixServer)
}
```

to utilize it, enabling React 18 streaming for both Vercel runtimes.",2023,2

Adds support for server-side rendered Remix using Edge Functions. This runtime can be enabled on a per-page basis, by adding the following to a page within the `app/routes` directory:

```js
export const config = {
  runtime: 'edge'
};
```

Additionally, this PR further supersedes the `@remix-run/vercel` runtime adapter, because we will always inject our own server entrypoint. So the logic to ensure that package exists in the project's `package.json` has been removed (so this closes #9011). The only requirement is that the Remix project has `@remix-run/node` as a dependency, which is the case for the vanilla Remix template so I think that's a fair assumption.

To make Edge Functions work, we need to ensure that `remix build` is executed with a few specific configuration values in place, so this change wraps the existing `remix.config.js` file and adds our own to make sure those values are in place (and then cleans itself up after the build command is executed).

Finally, the reading of the Remix config logic was simplified by using the `readConfig()` function from the `@remix-run/dev` package, which also includes the routes manifest, so the hacky `vm` running logic to retrieve the manifest was able to be removed.

Closes #8784.
Closes #9011.

---

# To test this out:

1. Ensure that Remix dependencies are running _at least version `1.5.0`_ (which is when `writeReadableStreamToWritable()` was added to `@remix-run/node`).

2. Add the following line of code to any page in your Remix application’s `app/routes/*` directory:
    
    ```jsx
    export const config = { runtime: 'edge' };
    ```
    
3. Set an Environment Variable on your Vercel Project:
    - Name: `VERCEL_CLI_VERSION`
    - Value: `https://vercel-git-update-remix-edge.vercel.sh/tarballs/vercel.tgz`
    
4. Make a deployment, either by running `vercel deploy` in the CLI, or by pushing a Git commit to your repository which has a Vercel Git integration enabled.",2023,2

The error messages shown during `vc dev` when an Edge or Serverless functions returns a promise that ends up being rejected could be better.

Main changes:

- removed ""socket hang up"" error messages because they were not helpful to the user
- changed serverless function error handling to log explicitly and exit
- changed serverless function error message to include the request path
- changed edge function error message to include request path and a faked (but useful) stack trace

## Current

### In Production

**Serverless Function:** In production, for a serverless function rejected promise, you'll see this in the logs:

```
Unhandled Promise Rejection 	{
  ""errorType"": ""Runtime.UnhandledPromiseRejection"",
  ""errorMessage"": ""Error: intentional break!"",
  ""reason"": {
    ""errorType"": ""Error"",
    ""errorMessage"": ""intentional break!"",
    ""stack"": [
      ""Error: intentional break!"",

      ""    at parserOnIncoming (node:_http_server:956:12)"",
      ""    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:128:17)""
    ]
  },
  ""promise"": {},
  ""stack"": [
    ""Runtime.UnhandledPromiseRejection: Error: intentional break!"",
    ""    at process.<anonymous> (file:///var/runtime/index.mjs:1194:17)"",
    ""    at process.emit (node:events:539:35)"",
    ""    at process.emit (/var/task/___vc/__sourcemap_support.js:559:21)"",
    ""    at emit (node:internal/process/promises:140:20)"",

    ""    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:97:32)""
  ]
}
Unknown application error occurred
Runtime.Unknown
```

**Edge Function:** In production, for an edge function rejected promise, you'll see this in the logs:

```
Error: intentional break!
    at (api/edge.js:10:10)
```

In both cases, in the browser, you see the ""This Serverless/Edge Function has crashed."" template with no error message or stack trace.


### In `vc dev`


**Serverless Function:** In `vc dev`, for a serverless function rejected promise, you'll see this in the output:

```
Unhandled rejection: Error: intentional break!
    at handler (/Users/smassa/source/demo/edge-errors/api/node.js:3:9)
    at Server.<anonymous> (/Users/smassa/source/vercel/vercel/packages/node-bridge/helpers.js:813:19)
    at Server.emit (node:events:513:28)
    at Server.emit (node:domain:489:12)
    at parserOnIncoming (node:_http_server:998:12)
    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:128:17)
Error: Failed to complete request to /api/node: Error: socket hang up
```

**Edge Function:** In `vc dev`, for an edge function rejected promise, you'll see this in the output:

```
Unhandled rejection: intentional break!
Error: Failed to complete request to /api/edge: Error: socket hang up
```

## After Changes

### In `vc dev`


**Serverless Function:** In `vc dev`, for a serverless function rejected promise, you'll see this in the output:

```
Rejected Promise returned from /api/node: Error: intentional break!
    at handler (/Users/smassa/source/demo/edge-errors/api/node.js:3:9)
    at Server.<anonymous> (/Users/smassa/source/vercel/vercel/packages/node-bridge/helpers.js:824:19)
    at Server.emit (node:events:513:28)
    at Server.emit (node:domain:489:12)
    at parserOnIncoming (node:_http_server:998:12)
    at HTTPParser.parserOnHeadersComplete (node:_http_common:128:17)
```

**Edge Function:** In `vc dev`, for an edge function rejected promise, you'll see this in the output:

```
Rejected Promise returned from api/edge: intentional break!
    at (api/edge.ts)
```

We can't show the real stack trace for Edge Functions because the bundling + VM execution mangles it. What's rendered here is a fake one, but it's still useful to the user.

If we currently showed the real stack trace for edge functions, it would look like:

```
Rejected Promise returned from api/edge: intentional break!
    at edge (evalmachine.<anonymous>:35:9)
    at FetchEvent.<anonymous> (evalmachine.<anonymous>:87:26)
    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:96:5)

```

TS has an option, `noEmitOnError`, that is used to either fail the build by throwing when `true` or just print the error and continuing to build when `false`.

This PR fixes the case when `noEmitOnError: false`. Previously showing an error stack trace but now it correctly shows the error message without the stack.

There are times when a request can arrive for a Python function with headers as a list. One of those examples is this header `x-vercel-proxied-for` which apparently is set twice. Example:

`[b'x-vercel-proxied-for', [b'207.81.134.243', b'172.71.147.74']]`

I took a quick scan through the other Python server implementations and I don't think any of them manipulate the value of the HTTP headers, the way the ASGI one does so I think we are good there.

To reproduce:

`curl https://..../ -H ""foo: bar"" -H ""foo: bar""`

Will fail.

Since `actions/setup-node` is no longer used to restore the pnpm cache,

The `go` builder doesn't properly handle when `go build` fails. There are 2 failure scenarios:

1. The `go` binary is not found in the `PATH`. There is no message that the `go` executable was not found. Worse, the builder continues and fails trying to run the compiled executable:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97262/214765157-f5244467-7bc8-48e8-8fcf-385efc32b283.png)

The solution is to switch from `spawnSync()` to `execFileSync()` so that if `go` is not found, it will throw like this:

<img width=""507"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97262/214765388-792ce59a-79f5-4bc8-8088-472969729558.png"">
Note: I temporarily changed the code to spawn `gooooo` to simulate `go` not being found. Either way, `execFileSync()` will throw and we get a helpful message.

2. The `go build` fails due to some actual build error. This should never happen, but better safe than sorry.

The solution here is to allow `go build` to inherit stdout/stderr and if `go build` should fail, we can see the output:

<img width=""574"" alt=""image"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97262/214765614-c414f160-ad8e-4bd2-a628-b5a91dcc88d8.png"">",2023,1

Around 6 months ago, @styfle brought to my attention how `rename()` in build-utils used `reduce()` and could be written better. So, I rewrote it.

Before, the code would create a new `Files` object and copy the contents of the previous `Files` object. This caused heavy garbage collection and memory thrashing.

Instead, I created a single `Files` object, then add the files to it.

This PR:

- updates `packages/frameworks` to have most supported frameworks specify which dependency version should reflect the overall framework version
- updates `packages/fs-detectors` to allow framework detection that returns the full `Framework` record instead of just the slug
- updates `packages/next` to return the detected Next.js version in the build result
- updates `packages/cli` to leverage these changes so that `vc build` can add `framework: { version: string; }` to `config.json` output

The result is that Build Output API and supported frameworks will return their framework version in the build result of `vc build` when possible, which is used by the build container  when creating the deployment. The dashboard later retrieves this value to display in richer deployment outputs.

With the related build container updates, we get to see Next.js version in the build output. You'll see this with BOA+Prebuilt or a normal deploy:

---

### The Path to this PR

I went through all the supported frameworks and figured out how to best determine their versions. For most of them, we can check a known dependency's installed version number. 

We can get most of the way only checking npm. For a handful, we'd have to support Go/Ruby/Rust/Whatever dependencies.

I started with a more complex method signature to allow for later expansion without changing the signature. It looked like this, in practice:

```
async getVersion(dependencies: DependencyMap) => depedencies['next']
```

However, after checking all currently supported frameworks, I don't think this will end up being necessary. It also has the constraint that all dependencies have to be gathered and presented to the function even though it only needs to check for one or two. That's not a huge deal if we have them already where we need them, but we don't. We could use a variant here where this function does its own lookups, but this seemed unnecessary and would beg for duplication and small variances that could cause bugs.

Further, if we only look at `package.json`, we're going to either see a specific version of a version range. To be precise, we have to look at the installed version of the package. That means checking one of the various types of lockfiles that can exist or poking into node_modules.

If we poke into node_modules to detect the installed version, we introduce another point where Yarn 3 (default mode) will not be supported. If we read lockfiles, we have to potentially parse `npm`, `pnpm`, and `yarn` lockfiles.

If we use `npm ls <package-name>`, that also fails in Yarn 3 (default mode). We could accept that and go forward anyway, which would look like:

```
const args = `ls ${packageName} --depth=0 --json`.split(' ');
const { stdout } = await execa('npm', args, { cwd });
const regex = new RegExp(String.raw`${packageName}@([\.\d]+)`);
const matches = stdout.match(regex);
if (matches) {
  return matches[1];
}
```

But it turns out there's a `--json` option! That's what I ended up using, for now.

We could explore the lockfile route more, but after some initial digging, it' non-trivial. There are 3 main lockfiles we'd want to check for (npm, pnpm, and yarn) and there are different lockfile versions that put necessary data in different places. I looked for existing tools that parse this, but I didn't find any. We could certainly go down this path, but the effort doesn't seem worth it when `npm ls` gets us really close.

---

### Follow-up Versioning

Now that we know how to determine version per framework, we can vary configuration by version. In a future PR, we could allow a given value to vary by version number:

```
name: (version) => {
  if (semver.gt(version, '9.8.7')) {
    return 'some-framework-2''
  }

  return 'some-framework';
}
```

This PR bumps `@vercel/nft` (for production) and `ts-node` (for

Because Node.js cannot dynamically set [loader
hooks](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v18.x/api/esm.html#loaders) once a
process is started, I had to change the way `ts-node` is registered by
using environment variables such as `NODE_OPTIONS`. Most of the logic
